# Holidaze Booking Application

## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a modern front-end accommodation booking application for Holidaze, a newly launched accommodation booking site. I will be achieving this by using what ive learned through my two years of education.

## Brief

Holidaze has approached us to develop a brand new front-end for their application. The project involves creating both customer-facing and admin-facing interfaces, allowing users to book holidays at venues and enabling venue managers to manage their venues and bookings.

## Requirements

This project covers the front-end application for the Holidaze API. All API functionality is managed by an existing application provided by Noroff.
